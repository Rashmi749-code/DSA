#This provides a basic inventory management system. It defines two core functions: process_sale to handle sales and update stock quantities, and identify_zero_stock to find items that are out of stock. The code also includes a series of test cases to demonstrate and verify the functionality of these functions under different scenarios, such as normal sales, insufficient stock, and SKU not found errors
